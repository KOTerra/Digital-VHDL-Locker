Non-clocked latch  
The latch displayValueAtCount_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin displayValueAtCount_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch displayValueAtCount_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin displayValueAtCount_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 4 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
